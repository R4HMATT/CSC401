Thw two inf values at the beginning are probably due to lack of information, bad feature extraction, or potentially just bad testing,
data from my 40000 comment splice. After that however, we see an large increase at 15k and falls back down quite a bit. Its tough to
characterize but I would say it might be similar to the way neural networks tend to have 300 nodes "as a sweet spot" number for best
results, which similarly might be the case for the 15k comment range.
